       <p class="para">My personal carrer goals for the future to come. I want to work with computers but I don't know what yet but I liked volunterring at the Information System Department at Eisenhower. I want my carrer to work with computers beacuse over the summer I voulenterred for a month at the Information Systems Department and worked with the differnt people there but I want to explore more options with computers. I liked volunteering and going around with the Desktop team there, they showed me many diffrent things they had to do around the diffrent hospital campuses.</p>
        <p class="para"> I am currently in the Computer Science class at Palm Desert High School and am learning many skills about web design and codeing in general. I have built my own computer and upgraded it, I have also helped my friend build his first computer. Over the summer I also volunteered at the Information Systems Department at Eisenhower Medical Center. I learned from the diffrent people there and I also went around with the Desktop team at the Eisenhower Campus to fix work stations. I also helped program and erase data from many hard drives there.   </p>
        <p class="para">Here are the important characteristics I show. I am self-motivated, I show this beacuse I build my own computer by myself and helped my friend out when he was building his. I also signed up to volunteer over the summer with Eisenhower for a month. I am also very cooperative, I can show this beacsuse I worked well with my friend helping him out and worked with some of the employes at Eisenhower with projects that they had me do. At Palm Desert High School I have done Wrestling for one year and I have done track for one year so far.  </p>
        <p class="para">In conclusion I have some knowledge of how computers work and have had some experience with volunteering but have much more to learn. Thank you from reading my about me page and if you haven't already be sure to explore the rest of my page. </p>
