       <p class="para">My personal career goals for the future to come. I want to work with computers but I don't know what yet but I liked volunteering at the Information System Department at Eisenhower. I want my career to work with computers because over the summer I volunteered for a month at the Information Systems Department and worked with the different people there but I want to explore more options with computers. I liked volunteering and going around with the Desktop team there, they showed me many different things they had to do around the different hospital campuses.</p>
        <p class="para">   I am currently in the Computer Science class at Palm Desert High School and am learning many skills about web design and coding in general. I have built my computer and upgraded it, I have also helped my friend build his first computer. Over the summer I also volunteered at the Information Systems Department at Eisenhower Medical Center. I learned from the different people there and I also went around with the Desktop team at the Eisenhower Campus to fix work stations. I also helped the program and erase data from many hard drives there.    </p>
        <p class="para">   Here are the important characteristics I show. I am self-motivated, I show this because I build my computer by myself and helped my friend out when he was building his. I also signed up to volunteer over the summer with Eisenhower for a month. I am also very cooperative, I can show this because I worked well with my friend helping him out and worked with some of the employees at Eisenhower with projects that they had me do. Thank you for reading about me be sure to explore the rest of my page.  </p>
