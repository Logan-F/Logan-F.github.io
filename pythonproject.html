        <h2>Written Response for Python Project</h2>
        <p class="para">For our code we created a quiz that randomly gives you a question to answer, the code was written in Python 3. While making our code we came across some difficulties. For example we had a problem with randomizing the questions and getting out of the while loop. When fixing the randomizer for the question we had to do research on random loops and how to do random loops. After we did some research we found out how to use random loops and what code we need to put into our code to make it work then inputted into our code and then we had a working random quiz. We also encountered a problem with getting out of our while loop and states. We had to find a state to put the while loop in so it would end the code when someone got the question wrong or all questions were answered. In the project individually I did the randomizer function and inputted it into our while loops so that the questions would be random. </p>
